Netflix RS Summary:
various algorithms, including search
business purpose
A/B testing, offline experimentation data to improve the system
designing/interpreting A/B tests
areas of current innovation

Intro:
Netflix is inventing internet television
allows members to stream any video, anytime on any internet-connected device
internet television is young and competitive, so innovation is crucial
key pillar of netflix is the recommender system, which helps members find videos
RS consists of mutliple algos, serving different uses that work together to create the Netflix expeperience

The Netflix Recommender System:
internet tv about what/when/where to watch - vast options
ppl get overwhelmed by too many options
internet tv carries broad catalog to wide audience, including niche titles
typical netflix member loses interest after 60-90 seconds, then leaves the sight
recommender problem is to make sure the member finds something interesting in that initial window
Netflix used to rely on predicting the number of star ratings
But now, much more data
	what each member watches
	how "			" (device, time of day, day of week, intesity of watching)
	place in product where video was discovered
	viewed recommendations but not played
	etc.
use these data to more accurately predict what a member will watch
various algos converge on homepage - main presentation of recommendations
each row has a theme

Algo 1: Personalized Video Ranker (PVR)
typically 40 rows, 75 videos per row, per homepage
the videos in a row come from a single algo, the PVR
orders the entire catalog of videos (or subsets/filters) for each member in a personalized way
resulting ordering used to select order of videos in genre (why genre rows are difference btwn members)
PVR works best when using personalized signals with unpersonalized popularity, which is used for the Popular row
[Amatriain and Basilico, 2012]

Algo 2: Top-N Video Ranker
finds best few personalized recom's in entire catalog for each member
optimized/evaluated using metrics and algos that look only at the head of the ranking
similar to PVR

Algo 3: Trending Now Ranker
short-term trends are strong predictors fo videos members will watch
two types: yearly trends (romantic movies on Valentine's Day)
	   one-off, short-term events (big hurricane cause interest in documentaries about hurricanes)

Algo 4: Continue Watching Ranker
sorts the subset of recently viewed titles based on estimate of whether member will resume watching
signals include time elapsed since viewing, point of abandonement(mid-program vs. begin/end), 
whether different titles have been viewed since, and the devices used.
each ranking algo uses different math/stat models, signals, and data as input.
each requries different model trainings designed for the specific purpose of the ranekr.

Algo 5: Video-Video Similarity
Because You Watched rows are another type of categorization. It anchors its recommendations to a single video watched by the member.
the vid-vid sim algo drives recos in these rows. 
sims algo is unpersonalized algo that computes a ranked list of videos (similars) for every video in our catalog.
sims is unpersonalized, but which BYW rows make it onto a homepage is personalized
subset of BYW vids reco'ed in a row benefits from personalization, depending on what subsets of the similar videos we estimate a member would enjoy

Algo 6: Page Generation - Row Selection and Ranking
videos chosen for each row represents estimate of the best choices of videos put in front of a specific user
but moods change and many accounts are shared
thus, diverse selection of rows so members can skip over them
the page generation algo uses output of all algos to construct every page of recommendations, taking relevance and diversity into account
typical member has >10k rows that could go a homepage, making computation challenging
before 2015, used a rule-based approach
now, fully personalized math. algo that selects and orders rows from a large pool of candidates to create an ordering optimized for relevance and diversity.
[Alvino and Basilico, 2015]

Algo 7: Evidence
evidence selection algos help members decide if a video is for them
evidence is all the info at the top left of the page; predicted star rating, synopsis, cast, other metadata, and images
the algos evaluate all possible evidence items we can display for every reco, to select the few that we think will be most helpful for the member
ex: decide to show that a certain movie won an Oscar

Algo 8: Search
rec sys influences choices for 80% of hours streamed
remaining 20% comes from search, which uses several algos
one algo finds videos that match a query
second algo predicts interest in a concept given a partial query
third algo find video reco's for a given concept
these algos combine play data, search data, and metadata to arrive at the results

Algo 9: Related Work
each algo relies on statistical/machine-learning techniques
inclueds supervised (classification/regression) and unsupervised (dimensionality reduction thru clustering/compression)


Business Value
want to be enormous, global business
helps members engage with service so that they don't leave
personalization allows for niche videos
effective catalog size is a metric that describes how spread viewing is across items in catalog.
if most viewing goes to single video, it is close to 1
if all videos have same amount of viewing then number will be close to num of videos in the catalog
