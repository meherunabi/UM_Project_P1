Two Decades of Recommender Systems at Amazon:
Intro
amazon building a store for every customer
from catalog of 100s of millions, amazon picks a small number of items based off current context and past behavior.
algorithm shares what other people like
item-based collaborative filtering algorithm developed in 90s has been hugely successful

Algorithm
first finds related items for each item in the catalog
related means "people who buy one item are unusually likely to buy the other"
once this related items table is built, can generate recommendations quickly as a series of lookups
for each item in current context and previous interests,
	look up related items
	combine them to yield most likely items of interest
	filter out items already seen/purchased,
	left with items to recommend
advantage;
	majority of computation done offile
	recommendations are high quality and remain competitive
	scales to 100s of millions of items without sampling
	algo updates immediately on new info about a person's interest
	easily explainable

In 2003, published paper in IEEE
But since then there has been massive growth
found ways to refine the algo to procude more relevant recommendations
Defining "related" items
	a problem in statistics
	people buy more non-expensive items
	no one score that works best all the time
	need to pick best parameters
	compatibility

Importance of Time
how related a purchase is given another purchase relies heavily on time
some things bought sequentially i.e. camera and then a memory card, not vice versa
cold-start problems - can use explore/exploit process


The Future: Recommendations Everywher
no need to type search keywords in a box
discovery will be like talking to a friend who knows you and anticipates your needs
instead of recommender systems, a focus on understanding the customer
